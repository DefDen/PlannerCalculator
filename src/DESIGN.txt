To implement the tasks and calender functionality we used the
java.util.Calendar library and the java.util.GregorianCalendar library.  
Using these libraries,we link values for year, month, day, hour, and minute
together in one class. This means in communicating between classes and methods
we don't have to pass each of those 5 variables individually, instead we pass
a class which contains them. Each task uses a calender instance for us to better
determine if there were conflicts between tasks, wheather one came before another,
and where to best place loose tasks.

The ScheduleBuilder class uses multiple nested collections with outer HashMaps. 
These HashMaps link a String key signifying a particular day to collections of tasks.
This structure is useful because it shows what tasks happen on each day.

One of these nested collections is an array of tasks. We use an array
because we want the number of elements fixed at 288, the number of minutes in the day / 5.
This makes each item in the array represent a 5 minute interval within a day, either
containing a task if there is a task to be done at that time, or not containing a task 
if there is not.
