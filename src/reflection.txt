We learned a learned a lot about version control and GitHub, which is also
consequently what we had the most trouble with. We had constant trouble
pushing since there were merge conflicts in the repository, and due to
those conflicts we had multiple branches of the code being worked on
simultaneously and differences in the code being developed. Despite that,
we had fun working on the project since it was challenging and something
we both wanted to work on. Even if the final product isn't what we hoped
for, we definitely learned a lot about how to work together better
in the future.
