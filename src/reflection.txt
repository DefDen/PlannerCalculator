We learned a learned a lot about version control and GitHub, which is also
consequently what we had the most trouble with. We had constant trouble
pushing since there were merge conflicts in the repository, and due to
those conflicts we had multiple branches of the code being worked on
simultaneously and differences in the code being developed. Despite that,
we had fun working on the project since it was challenging and something
we both wanted to work on. Theorizing ways to optimize a schedule was fun.
Ultimately, understanding that type of problem seems to require levels of math
we are not at yet. We came up with some interesting ideas combining
heuristics which each represent different standards of a good. Despite progress
we made in evaluating a schedule once already given, we couldn't figure out how
to generate candidate schedules in a reasonable amount of time. The key issue is
we didn't know how to represent times as mathematical variables to create a master
function for an optimal schedule. Even if we weren't able to work with heuristics
like we wanted, we learned a lot about coding as a team.
