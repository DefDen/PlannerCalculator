# PlannerCalculator
This project creates a schedule for you. It takes as inputs two types of tasks: loose tasks and strict tasks. Strict tasks are the most intuitive. They have a name, a start time, and an end time. They get put into the schedule at the proper time. Loose tasks are less intuitive. Loose tasks have a deadline and a number of minutes you estimate it will take to complete them. The project distributes those minutes from now until the deadline in a reasonable way. If possible, it distributes 1 hour to each day starting the deadline day and moving backwards in time. If there arenâ€™t enough days to do 1 hour a day, it distributes the amount of time which makes it an even amount of that task per day from today until the deadline. Within a day, based on input user preference for day time or night time work, it distributes the task earlier in the day or later in the day, avoiding sleeping hours and tasks that are already there.

In Main.java, press play to run the program. It will give you instructions and ask for inputs. You can give strict tasks or loose tasks. Give inputs carefully in the correct format. When inputting a time, the format is month, day, year, hour, minute. Note that hour uses military time, meaning the hour 7 PM is written as 19. Every time you input a task, the program will print your schedule.
